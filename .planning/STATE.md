## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- [Roadmap]: 3 phases (coarse granularity), skills first then test then stabilize
- [Roadmap]: STAB-01 (bug fixes from testing) grouped with Phase 2 since bugs are discovered during testing
- [Phase 01]: Moved compatibility to metadata map per Anthropic Agent Skills Spec 1.0
- [Phase 01]: Registered session-share in marketplace.json for independent discoverability
- [Phase 01]: Model profiles table uses per-agent granularity instead of simplified category view
- [Phase 01]: Slash commands organized into 4 categories (Core Lifecycle, Milestone, Phase, Utilities)
- [Phase 02]: Lifecycle tests in separate file (lifecycle_test.go) for organized concerns
- [Phase 02]: Attach tests verify preconditions only (PTY required for full test, documented as manual)
- [Phase 02]: Shell sessions during tmux startup window show StatusStarting from tmux layer; tests verify Start() contract separately from UpdateStatus() behavior
- [Phase 02]: Runtime tests verify file readability (os.ReadFile) at materialized paths, not just existence
- [Phase 02]: STAB-01 satisfied without production code fixes; all Plan 01/02 deviations were test assertion adjustments
- [Phase 03]: No dead code or stale artifacts found; codebase clean after Phases 1-2
- [Phase 03]: Default golangci-lint config intentional; no .golangci.yml added per project convention
- [Phase 03]: No Removed section needed in changelog; Plan 01 confirmed no dead code
